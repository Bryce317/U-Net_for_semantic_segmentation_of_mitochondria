# U-Net_for_semantic_segmentation_of_mitochondria
The goal is to segment automatically mitochondria in EM images. This is a semantic segmentation problem where pairs of EM image and its corresponding mitochodria mask 
are provided. Our purpose is to segment automatically other mitochondria in images not used during train labeling each pixel with the corresponding class: background or 
foreground.
